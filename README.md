# Device managment system

During my internship, I developed a  Device Management System designed to streamline the management of various devices. The project integrates a Spring Boot backend with a PostgreSQL database and a React frontend using CoreUI to provide a robust, user-friendly interface for adding, editing, deleting, sorting and filtering devices.

## Technologies Used

### React
- **Frontend Framework**: React was used to build the dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **CoreUI**: CoreUI provided a set of customizable UI components that enhanced the visual appeal and usability of the application. Components like CButton, CCol, CForm, CFormInput, CModal, and others were utilized.

### Spring Boot
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot served as the backbone of the server-side application, providing a robust and scalable structure for developing RESTful APIs.
- **Hibernate Validator**: Used for validation purposes, ensuring that all device data met specified criteria before being processed and stored in the database.

### PostgreSQL
- **Database**: PostgreSQL was chosen for its reliability and powerful features, handling the storage, retrieval, and management of device data efficiently.
